This file proves soundness for simply typed lambda calculus by interpreting
terms with a step-indexed logical relation. The step index is the fuel used to
reason about functions recursively: a function is safe for `fuel` when, for
any `lessFuel ≤ fuel`, it sends semantically safe inputs to outputs that
stay safe one guarded step later.

All docstrings use short (under 5 lines) of Scala code as demonstrations.
