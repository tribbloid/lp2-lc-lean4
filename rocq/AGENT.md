# AGENT.md - Project Information

## Project Overview
This is a Coq formalization project working with formal type theory, specifically focused on DOT calculus (Dependent Object Types) and F-sub (System F with subtyping). The project contains multiple formalization attempts and related work on type systems.

## Project Structure
- **Root directory**: Contains main Coq files with different formalization approaches
- **__original/**: Original files for old Coq 8.4 syntax
- **active/**: Working directory with current development files
- **finished/**: Completed formalization files
- **.history/**: Version history directory

## Key Files
- **Fsub.v**: System F with subtyping formalization
- **DotTransitivity*.v**: DOT calculus formalization with transitivity studies
- **Records.v**: Record type formalization
- **ip-pr-lambdaDot*.v**: Lambda DOT calculus with intersection and union types
- **stable_typ-*.v**: Stable type formalization for DOT calculus

## Dependencies
- **Coq version**: 8.18.0
- **Main library**: LibLN (Locally Nameless representation library)
- **TLC libraries**: Used for tactical libraries (TLC.LibTactics, TLC.LibLN, etc.)

## Build Commands
Since there's no Makefile or dune-project, files are compiled individually:

```bash
# Compile a single Coq file
coqc filename.v

# Check syntax without compilation
coq_makefile -f _CoqProject -o Makefile  # if _CoqProject exists
make

# For files with dependencies, compile in order:
# 1. First compile dependencies (LibLN should be available)
# 2. Then compile the target file
```

## Common Commands
```bash
# Type check a file
coqc -q filename.v

# Interactive development
coqide filename.v

# Check dependencies
coqdep filename.v
```

## Development Notes
- Uses **Set Implicit Arguments** for cleaner syntax
- Follows locally nameless representation for variable binding
- Heavy use of mutual inductive types (typ/dec definitions)
- Environment-based typing contexts using LibEnv operations

## File Types
- **`.v`**: Coq source files
- **`.vo`**: Compiled Coq object files
- **`.glob`**: Global information files generated by Coq
- **`.aux`**: Auxiliary files

## Code Style
- Inductive types use lowercase prefixes (typ_, dec_, etc.)
- Constructors follow naming pattern: `type_constructor`
- Heavy use of LibLN tactics and notations
- Environment operations use custom notations (`, ~:, ~<:, etc.)

## Testing
No automated test suite detected. Verification is done through:
- Coq's type checker ensuring all proofs are valid
- Individual file compilation to check for errors
- Interactive proof development in CoqIDE

## Related Work
This appears to be related to:
- DOT calculus research (Dependent Object Types)
- System F subtyping 
- Type safety proofs for object-oriented type systems
- Locally nameless representation techniques
